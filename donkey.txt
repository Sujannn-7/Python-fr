The donkey wakes up, stretches like a professional donkey, and immediately starts doing donkey business.
The donkey walks, the donkey works, and the donkey wonders why everyone keeps calling someone else a donkey.
Every problem somehow becomes the donkey’s problem, and yet the donkey keeps going, carrying loads, carrying drama, and carrying the reputation of being “just a donkey.” 
Deep down, the donkey knows the truth: without the donkey, half the world would be late, lost, or still trying to move that one heavy thing.
Long live the donkey, the real MVP of donkey society.
